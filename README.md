Hello! This is the officical unofficial GitHub page for all code pertaining to Dr. Hogan's beam autoalignment project. For now, there are three main folders, though the latter two may at some point be divided based on what portion of the project they cover.

### 1.) The Experiments Folder
This folder contains all the junk I've made while testing general concepts. Expect no legible or useful code from this folder. Examples include pieces of scrap meant to lest libraries for the Newport Picomotor8742, testing how to continually update labels for tkinter, etc. 

The only reason these files are kept are because of their use in troubleshooting (and because I spent way too much time on them initially, haha)

### 2.) Project Files
This folder contains all of the main project files in Jupyter Notebook formatting. I tend to write all code as a Jupyter Notebook first due to how handy individual cell excecution is for troubleshooting. While the "completed" project will probably be all .py files for the purpose of actual usage, I'm keeping the original notebooks around in case we want to modify the final files after the project is done (which we absolutely will like come on).

### 3.) Project Files (.py)
As the name implies, this folder is simply the contents of Project Files converted into a .py file. Once the project is "done", in so far as any project is ever truly finished, you'll want to download and run the contents of this file for beam alignment. Also, certain later project files will refer to a main.py which contains all of the important functions for this project, which means main.py will have to be imported. Even if you want to work in a Jupyter Notebook setting to modify these files, you'll have to download the .py file for main in order to operate these later files. Sorry 'bout that.

### Additional Comments
I am as much of a coder as a retired suburban dad with a cabin 20 miles from Lake Tahoe is a fisherman, which is to say that any game we talk is almost certainly unfounded. This code is crap. It is at best functional, and even that is a stretch. If you find ways to improve (which you will), please do us all a favor, change it, and let me know so I can replace existing files.

Thanks y'all <3
